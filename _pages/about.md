<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

<!-- Hi, I'm Eyad! I'm a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics (MPI-INF), where I'm part of the Computer Vision and Machine Learning group. My work with the RTG 2853 Neuroexplicit Models of Language, Vision, and Action program focuses on a key question: how do deep learning models actually work? By exploring this, I'm hoping to develop more reliable and trustworthy AI. I've been with the program since October 2024 and am supervised by Prof. Bernt Schiele and co-supervised by Prof. Jilles Vreeken. -->

Hi, I'm Eyad! Since October 2024, I've been a PhD student with the [RTG 2853 Neuroexplicit Models of Language, Vision, and Action program](https://www.neuroexplicit.org/). I work at the [Max Planck Institute for Informatics (MPI-INF)](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning/people/eyad-alshami), where I'm part of the [Explainable Machine Learning Group](https://explainablemachines.com/) within the [Computer Vision and Machine Learning department](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning/). My core research mission is to go beyond the "black box" of deep learning. By uncovering how these models think, I hope to create a new generation of AI that we can trust. I'm grateful to be guided in this work by **[Prof. Bernt Schiele](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z76PBfYAAAAJ)** and **[Prof. Jilles Vreeken](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p5HEQfIAAAAJ&hl=en)**.
